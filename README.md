# colors
This module contains the various RGB color values along with a random_color() function to generate a random color. Please note that this is my personally created module and is not published to PyPi!

How to Use : 
  1. Download this repositiory as a .zip file.
  2. Extract the colors.py file and place it where Python is installed (to ensure you can use it anywhere). Please understand that this colors.py is not the PyPi colors.py module, so if you have installed that, you may want to rename this colors.py file to something else to be able to use both the modules properly, but then you will also need to use the same new name while importing it.
  3. Now, open Python and try doing import colors (or the new name of the module if you changed it)
